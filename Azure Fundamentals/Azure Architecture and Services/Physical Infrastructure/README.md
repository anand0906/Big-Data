<h1>Azure Accounts</h1>
<p><strong>Azure Subscriptions Overview:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Azure Account and Subscription:</strong> When you create an Azure account, a subscription is automatically set up for you. You can add more subscriptions to organize resources for different departments or projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Use:</strong> A company might use a single Azure account but have multiple subscriptions (e.g., for development, marketing, and sales) to manage and separate resources.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Free Azure Account:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>What’s Included:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>12 months of free access to popular Azure products.</li>
            <li>$200 credit to use within the first 30 days.</li>
            <li>Access to 25+ products that remain free after the initial period.</li>
        </ol>

</ul>

<p><strong>Microsoft Learn Sandbox:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Allows you to experiment with Azure services during Learn modules without using your own subscription or incurring costs.</li>
    <li><strong>How it Works:</strong> The sandbox creates a temporary Azure subscription for your account, which is automatically cleaned up after you complete the learning module.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Using the sandbox is preferred over using your personal subscription when working through Learn modules to avoid unnecessary charges.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Azure Architecture</h1>
<p>Azure's architecture can be divided into two main parts:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Physical Infrastructure</li>
	<li>Management Infrastructure</li>
</ol>

<h2>Physical Infrastructure</h2>
<p>This refers to the actual, physical hardware that powers Azure. Imagine data centers located all around the world—these are massive buildings filled with servers, storage devices, and networking equipment. These data centers are grouped into what Azure calls "Regions" and "Availability Zones."</p>
<h3>Region<</h3>
<p>A region is a specific geographical area, like "East US" or "West Europe." Each region contains multiple data centers. Choosing a region allows you to decide where your data and resources will be physically located.</p>
<p>For example, if your business is in Europe, you might want your data to be stored in the "West Europe" region for better performance.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Why Regions Matter: When you create or deploy resources (like virtual machines, databases, or web apps) in Azure, you need to decide in which region those resources should be located. The region you choose can have a direct impact on</li>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Choosing a region close to your users or customers can reduce latency, leading to faster response times.</li>
		<li><strong>Compliance and Legal Requirements</strong>: Some organizations need to store data within specific regions due to legal or regulatory requirements.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>Azure uses intelligent algorithms to manage resources within each region, ensuring that the workload is well-balanced and no single data center is overloaded.</p>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Service Availability:</strong> Not every Azure service or virtual machine (VM) feature is available in every region. For instance, some specific VM sizes or advanced storage options might only be offered in certain regions.</li>
    <li><strong>Global Azure Services:</strong> Some services are global and don’t need you to select a region at all. Examples include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD):</strong> Used for identity and access management across your Azure resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Azure Traffic Manager:</strong> A global traffic-routing service that helps distribute traffic across different regions.</li>
            <li><strong>Azure DNS:</strong> A global service that manages domain name resolution.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you’re setting up an online store. Your primary customers are in the US and Europe. To ensure fast loading times, you would want to deploy your resources (like your web server) in a region close to these users, such as “East US” or “West Europe.” However, if you need a specific service that’s only available in “North Europe,” you would have to select that region specifically.</p>

<p>In summary, regions are the physical foundation of Azure’s global presence, allowing you to strategically place your resources where they can perform best and meet your business needs.</p>

<h3>Availability Zones:</h3>
<p>Availability zones are physically separate data centers within an Azure region. Each availability zone consists of one or more data centers that are designed to be independent from each other. These data centers within a zone have their own power, cooling, and networking systems to ensure they can operate independently.</p>

<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/wwl-azure/describe-core-architectural-components-of-azure/media/availability-zones-c22f95a3.png">

<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Isolation Boundary:</strong> Availability zones are set up to be isolation boundaries. This means that if one zone experiences issues or goes down, the other zones in the region will continue to operate normally. This setup helps to maintain the availability and reliability of your services.</li>
    <li><strong>High-Speed Connectivity:</strong> Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks. This ensures fast and reliable communication between zones within the same region.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>To ensure resiliency, a minimum of three separate availability zones are present in all availability zone-enabled regions. This setup provides redundancy and helps to protect against failures.</li>
    <li>However, not all Azure regions currently support availability zones. You should check the availability of zones in your chosen region before planning your deployment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using Availability Zones in Your Apps</strong></p>
<p>To ensure that your services and data are safe and available even if something goes wrong, you need to implement redundancy. Redundancy means having backup systems or copies of your data and services in place so that if one part fails, others can take over.</p>

<p><strong>In traditional setups</strong>, this usually means creating duplicate hardware environments, which can be expensive and complex.</p>

<p><strong>In Azure</strong>, you can achieve high availability and redundancy more efficiently using Availability Zones.</p>

<p><strong>How Availability Zones Help:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mission-Critical Applications:</strong> If you have important applications that need to be available all the time (like banking systems or online stores), you can use Availability Zones to make sure they stay operational even if there’s a problem in one part of the data center.</li>
    <li><strong>Redundancy Within Zones:</strong> You can place your application’s components (like virtual machines, storage, and network resources) in different Availability Zones within the same region. This way, if one zone has an issue, the others can continue to provide service.</li>
    <li><strong>Replication Across Zones:</strong> To ensure even higher availability, you can replicate your resources across different Availability Zones. This means you create copies of your data and services in multiple zones.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that using Availability Zones may incur additional costs for duplicating services and transferring data between zones.</p>

<p><strong>Categories of Azure Services with Availability Zones:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Zonal Services:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> You assign these resources to a specific zone.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Virtual Machines (VMs), managed disks, and IP addresses.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> If you need to ensure a VM is in a particular zone, you would use zonal services.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Zone-Redundant Services:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Azure automatically replicates these services across multiple zones.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Zone-redundant storage, SQL Database.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> These services are designed to handle failures automatically by spreading data across zones.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Non-Regional Services:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> These services are available across all Azure geographies and are resilient to both zone-wide and region-wide outages.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Some global services like Azure Traffic Manager.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> These services are designed to remain operational even if a large-scale issue affects multiple zones or regions.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Further Resilience: Azure Region Pairs</strong></p>
<p>Even with Availability Zones, very large-scale events could potentially impact multiple zones in a region. To provide even greater resilience, Azure uses <strong>Region Pairs</strong>.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Region Pairs:</strong> Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geographical area. These pairs are designed to handle larger-scale failures and ensure that even if one region has a major issue, the paired region can continue to provide services.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine running an online store where you need to ensure the website is always up and running. You decide to use Azure Availability Zones:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Deploy your web servers</strong> in different zones within the same region. If one zone experiences a power outage, the web servers in other zones will keep the website running.</li>
    <li><strong>Store customer data</strong> in zone-redundant storage so that if one zone fails, the data remains accessible from another zone.</li>
    <li><strong>Use global services</strong> like Azure Traffic Manager to manage traffic and direct users to the nearest functional region if there’s a widespread issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>By implementing these strategies, you ensure your online store remains available and reliable, even during unexpected events.</p>


<h3>Azure Region Pairs</h3>
<p>Azure regions are often paired with another region within the same geographical area (like the US, Europe, or Asia), and they are usually separated by at least 300 miles. This pairing strategy helps in several ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Geographical Separation:</strong> By placing regions far apart, Azure can reduce the risk of both regions being affected by the same event. For example, if a natural disaster affects one region, the other, distant region in the pair can continue to operate.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Failover:</strong> If a region in a pair experiences an issue (such as a natural disaster), Azure can automatically switch services to the other region in the pair. This process is known as "failover."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the West US region encounters a major issue, services can failover to the East US region, ensuring that your applications remain available.</p>

<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Not Automatic for All Services:</strong> Not all Azure services automatically replicate data across paired regions or failover automatically. In such cases, you need to configure replication and recovery yourself to ensure data is available in the paired region.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you're using a service that doesn’t automatically replicate, you’ll need to set up manual replication to the paired region to ensure your data is safe.</p>

<p><strong>Examples of Region Pairs:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>West US</strong> is paired with <strong>East US</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>South-East Asia</strong> is paired with <strong>East Asia</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These regions are connected and separated enough to handle major regional issues, making them reliable for providing service continuity and data redundancy.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Advantages of Region Pairs:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Priority Restoration:</strong> If there is a widespread Azure outage, one region from each pair is prioritized for restoration. This means that at least one region in each pair is brought back online as quickly as possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Staggered Updates:</strong> Azure rolls out updates to paired regions one at a time. This reduces the risk of downtime or application outages during maintenance.</li>
    <li><strong>Geographical Compliance:</strong> Data remains within the same geographical area as its paired region (except for Brazil South), which helps with tax and legal jurisdiction requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important Note on Pairing Directions:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bidirectional Pairing:</strong> Most Azure regions are paired in both directions. This means that each region in the pair serves as a backup for the other.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> West US and East US back each other up.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Unidirectional Pairing:</strong> Some regions are paired in only one direction. In these cases, the primary region does not serve as a backup for its secondary region.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>West India</strong> is paired with <strong>South India</strong>, but <strong>South India</strong>’s secondary region is <strong>Central India</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Brazil South</strong> is uniquely paired with <strong>South Central US</strong>, but <strong>South Central US</strong> does not use <strong>Brazil South</strong> as a backup.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sovereign Regions</h3>
<p>In addition to the standard Azure regions, Microsoft also offers <strong>sovereign regions</strong>. These are specialized instances of Azure that operate independently from the main Azure cloud infrastructure. Sovereign regions are designed to meet specific compliance, legal, or regulatory requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of Sovereign Regions:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Compliance Requirements:</strong> Some organizations, especially government bodies or companies in regulated industries, may have strict requirements for data handling and privacy. Sovereign regions help meet these requirements by providing isolated and controlled environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal and Regulatory Needs:</strong> Sovereign regions ensure that data stays within particular jurisdictions, which is important for complying with local laws and regulations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples of Azure Sovereign Regions:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>U.S. Government Regions:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>US DoD Central:</strong> Designed for the U.S. Department of Defense, these regions are physically and logically isolated from other Azure regions. They have additional compliance certifications and are operated by screened U.S. personnel.</li>
            <li><strong>US Gov Virginia and US Gov Iowa:</strong> These regions cater to U.S. government agencies and partners, offering enhanced security and compliance features.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>China Regions:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>China East and China North:</strong> These regions are part of a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet. In this arrangement, Microsoft does not directly maintain the data centers. Instead, 21Vianet operates them, providing a version of Azure that complies with Chinese regulations.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Points to Remember:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Sovereign regions are separate from the main Azure cloud to ensure compliance and legal requirements are met.</li>
    <li><strong>Partnerships:</strong> In regions like China, Microsoft collaborates with local partners to operate data centers, aligning with regional regulations.</li>
    <li><strong>Special Compliance:</strong> These regions often include additional compliance certifications and security measures tailored to the needs of government and regulated industries.</li>
</ul>



<h1>Azure Management Infrastructure</h1>
<p>The management infrastructure in Azure consists of various elements that help you organize, manage, and oversee your cloud resources and services. It provides a structured approach to handling your Azure environment, ensuring that resources are effectively deployed, monitored, and maintained.</p>
<h2>Azure Resources</h2>
<p>
    Azure resources are the individual components and services that you create, configure, and manage within Azure. They are the building blocks of your Azure environment.
</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Virtual Machines (VMs):</strong> Compute resources that run applications and services.</li>
    <li><strong>Virtual Networks:</strong> Provide network connectivity and isolation.</li>
    <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Store and manage data for applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Cognitive Services:</strong> Offer AI and machine learning capabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage Accounts:</strong> Store data such as files and blobs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resource Groups</h2>
<p>
    Resource groups are containers that group together related Azure resources. Each resource group holds resources that share the same lifecycle, permissions, and policies.
</p>

<h3>Key Characteristics of Resource Groups:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Single Resource Group Per Resource:</strong> A resource must be assigned to exactly one resource group. While you can move resources between groups, a resource can only belong to one group at a time.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Nested Structure:</strong> Resource groups cannot be nested. You cannot place one resource group inside another.</li>
    <li><strong>Action Propagation:</strong> Actions taken on a resource group affect all resources within that group. For example:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deleting a Resource Group:</strong> Removes all resources contained within it.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Setting permissions on a resource group applies those permissions to all resources within the group.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility in Structuring:</strong> There are no strict rules for how to structure resource groups. It’s important to design them in a way that best fits your operational needs and access management requirements.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Practical Use Cases for Resource Groups:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Temporary Environments:</strong>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you’re setting up a temporary development environment, you might group all related resources (VMs, databases, etc.) into a single resource group. When development is complete, you can easily delete the entire resource group to clean up all associated resources at once.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Access Management:</strong>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> For a production environment that requires different access levels for different teams, you might create separate resource groups for each access schema. This allows you to grant specific permissions to each resource group, ensuring that users only have access to the resources they need.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Project-Based Grouping:</strong>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you’re working on multiple projects, you might create a resource group for each project. This helps in managing resources, tracking costs, and applying policies on a per-project basis.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Resources</strong> are individual Azure components that you create and manage.<br>
    <strong>Resource Groups</strong> organize and manage resources, applying actions and permissions to all resources within the group.<br>
    Proper planning and structuring of resource groups can simplify management, access control, and cost tracking.
</p>
<p>
    By understanding and leveraging resources and resource groups effectively, you can ensure efficient management of your Azure environment, tailored to your specific needs and organizational requirements.
</p>

<h2>What Are Azure Subscriptions?</h2>
<p><strong>Azure subscriptions</strong> are like memberships or plans that you sign up for to use Microsoft's Azure services. When you have a subscription, you get access to various cloud services and resources that Azure offers, such as virtual machines, databases, storage, and more.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: If Azure is a large library full of different books (services and resources), then a subscription is your library card that allows you to check out and use those books.</p>

<h2>Organizing Resources with Subscriptions and Resource Groups</h2>
<p>In Azure, organization is key to managing your resources effectively. There are two main ways to organize resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Resource Groups:</strong> These are like folders where you group related resources together. For example, if you're running a web application, you might have one resource group that contains the web server, database, and storage account all related to that app.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> These are higher-level groupings that contain multiple resource groups. Subscriptions help you manage and organize your resource groups and also play a crucial role in billing and access control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Imagine you're running multiple projects (resource groups) within your company. Each project has its own set of tools and documents. To keep things organized and manage costs, you place these projects under different departments (subscriptions). This way, you can track expenses and control who has access to which projects easily.</p>

<h2>Accessing Azure Through Subscriptions</h2>
<p>To start using Azure services, you must have at least one subscription. Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Azure Account:</strong> This is your identity or profile in Azure, usually linked to your email address and authenticated through Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).</li>
  <li><strong>Subscription:</strong> Linked to your Azure account, this grants you permission to use Azure services. It determines what resources you can access and how you are billed for using them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> When you sign up for Azure, you create an account using your email. Then, you choose a subscription plan that fits your needs. This subscription allows you to create and manage resources in Azure, and Azure charges you based on the subscription plan and resources you use.</p>

<h2>Multiple Subscriptions in One Account</h2>
<p>You can have multiple subscriptions under a single Azure account. This setup is beneficial for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Different Billing Models:</strong> You might want to separate costs for different projects, departments, or environments (like development, testing, and production). Each subscription generates its own billing report and invoice, making it easier to track and manage expenses separately.</li>
  <li><strong>Access Management:</strong> Subscriptions can help enforce different access policies. For example, you can have one subscription for the IT department with full access to all resources and another for the marketing department with limited access.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Suppose your company has two departments: Development and Marketing. You can create two subscriptions under your company’s Azure account—one for each department. This way, you can monitor and control the costs incurred by each department separately and set specific access permissions for each team.</p>

<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/wwl-azure/describe-core-architectural-components-of-azure/media/subscriptions-d415577b.png">

<h2>Types of Subscription Boundaries</h2>
<p>Azure subscriptions help define boundaries in two main ways:</p>

<h3>1. Billing Boundary</h3>
<p>This determines how Azure charges you for the services you use. By creating multiple subscriptions, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Separate Costs:</strong> Allocate budgets for different teams or projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Detailed Billing:</strong> Get separate invoices and reports for each subscription to understand where and how money is being spent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you're running two projects simultaneously, you can have separate subscriptions for each. This way, you know exactly how much each project is costing you without mixing up the expenses.</p>

<h3>2. Access Control Boundary</h3>
<p>This defines who can access what within your Azure environment. By setting up different subscriptions, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Control Access:</strong> Grant or restrict permissions to users or groups for specific resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Enhance Security:</strong> Ensure that sensitive data and resources are only accessible to authorized personnel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> You can create a subscription for your HR department that allows access only to HR-related applications and data, preventing other departments from accessing sensitive employee information.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In simple terms, Azure subscriptions are essential for organizing and managing your use of Azure services. They help you:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Access Azure Services:</strong> By providing the necessary permissions.</li>
  <li><strong>Organize Resources:</strong> By grouping resource groups logically.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage Costs:</strong> By separating billing for different projects or departments.</li>
  <li><strong>Control Access:</strong> By setting specific permissions and policies for different users or teams.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding how Azure subscriptions work allows you to effectively plan, deploy, and manage your resources in the cloud while keeping control over costs and security.</p>

<h2>Azure Management Groups</h2>
<p><strong>Azure management groups</strong> are an advanced way to organize and manage your resources in Azure, especially when dealing with large-scale environments.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Hierarchy</h3>
<p>In Azure, resources (like virtual machines, databases, etc.) are organized in a hierarchy:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Resources</strong> are grouped into <strong>Resource Groups</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Resource Groups</strong> are grouped into <strong>Subscriptions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For many small to medium-sized setups, this hierarchy might be enough. However, as your Azure environment grows, especially across different applications, teams, and geographical regions, managing everything just through subscriptions can become overwhelming.</p>

<h3>What Are Azure Management Groups?</h3>
<p>This is where <strong>Azure management groups</strong> come into play. Management groups provide an additional layer of organization above subscriptions. You can think of them as containers for your subscriptions. By grouping subscriptions under management groups, you can manage access, policies, and compliance more efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Imagine you're the CEO of a large company with multiple departments (subscriptions). Each department has its own projects (resource groups). Now, you want to apply company-wide rules and policies that affect all departments. Instead of setting these rules individually for each department, you create a new organizational layer—management groups—that allow you to apply rules that automatically affect all departments underneath.</p>

<h3>How Management Groups Work</h3>
<p>When you apply a policy or access rule to a management group, every subscription within that management group inherits those settings. This inheritance works similarly to how resource groups inherit settings from subscriptions, and individual resources inherit settings from resource groups.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you set a policy in a management group that only allows virtual machines (VMs) to be created in the US West Region, all subscriptions within that management group will automatically follow this rule. Even the resource or subscription owners can't change this, which helps maintain consistent governance across your organization.</p>

<h3>Building a Hierarchy with Management Groups</h3>
<p>Management groups allow you to build a flexible and scalable structure to manage your resources. You can create a hierarchy of management groups and subscriptions to organize resources according to your organizational needs. This hierarchy helps with unified policy enforcement and access management.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Representation (Imaginary Diagram):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>At the top, you have a <strong>Management Group</strong>.</li>
  <li>Below it, you have <strong>Subscriptions</strong> grouped under this management group.</li>
  <li>Further down, you have <strong>Resource Groups</strong> within each subscription, and finally, the <strong>Resources</strong> within each resource group.</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure ensures that policies and access controls set at the management group level are enforced all the way down the hierarchy.</p>

<h3>Practical Examples of Management Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Applying Policies Across Multiple Subscriptions:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have a production environment where you want all VMs to be hosted only in the US West Region.</li>
      <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Create a management group called "Production" and apply a policy that limits VM locations to the US West Region. Every subscription under this management group will automatically follow this policy, ensuring compliance without manual intervention.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Simplifying Access Management:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You want certain users to have access to multiple subscriptions.</li>
      <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Instead of setting up permissions for each subscription individually, you can group these subscriptions under a single management group and assign the necessary Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) at the management group level. This way, the permissions cascade down to all the subscriptions, resource groups, and resources underneath, simplifying access management.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Important Facts About Management Groups</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Large Scale:</strong> Azure allows up to 10,000 management groups in a single directory.</li>
  <li><strong>Hierarchy Depth:</strong> You can nest management groups up to six levels deep (not including the root level or subscription level).</li>
  <li><strong>Parent Limit:</strong> Each management group or subscription can have only one parent, ensuring a clear and organized hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
