<h1>Big Data</h1>
<h2>Data ?</h2>
<p>It is a collection of unorganized raw facts and figures which are collected from different sources</p>
<p>It can also be defined as ‘data is representation of raw facts, figures, concepts or instructions in a formalized manner which should be sharable and processed by the human or machine’</p>
<p>It can be in the form of integer, character, audio and video, symbols which have no meaning.</p>
<p>data is meaningless. It is required to be processed to make it meaningful.</p>
<p>Data refers to information that is collected, processed, and stored to be used for various purposes. It can take many forms, including numbers, text, images, audio, and video, and it can be raw or processed. </p>

<h2>Big Data</h2>
<p>Big Data is a field that focuses on the methods and technologies for dealing with data sets that are too large, complex, or dynamic to be processed using traditional data management tools</p>
<p>It consists of</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Analyzing : </strong>Using statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and other analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.</li>
	<li><strong>Systematically Extracting Information : </strong>Applying structured approaches to handle and interpret data, such as data mining and pattern recognition.</li>
	<li><strong>Managing Complex Data : </strong>Implementing technologies and methodologies to efficiently store, retrieve, and process vast amounts of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data refers to the massive amounts of data that are generated every second from various sources. This data is so large and complex that traditional data processing tools cannot handle it efficiently. Big Data encompasses structured data (like databases), semi-structured data (like XML files), and unstructured data (like videos, social media posts, and emails).</p>
<p><strong>Real-Time Example</strong></p>
<p>hink about social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter. Every time someone posts a status update, uploads a photo, likes a post, comments on a video, or sends a message, data is generated. This data includes not only the content itself but also metadata like the time of the post, the location, and the interactions it receives. Collectively, this generates terabytes (or even petabytes) of data daily, which constitutes Big Data.</p>

<h3>Types Of Data (Based On purposes of data analysis and usage)</h3>

<h3>Key Concepts Of Big Data</h3>
<h4>Volume</h4>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Volume refers to the sheer amount of data being generated and collected. As data sources multiply and the ability to store data improves, organizations are dealing with vast quantities of data that can range from terabytes to exabytes.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Terabytes:</strong> Data volumes often reach into terabytes (TB) and beyond. For example, a large social media platform may handle several terabytes of data daily.</li>
    <li><strong>Records:</strong> Individual data entries or pieces of information, such as rows in a database table.</li>
    <li><strong>Transactions:</strong> Actions or operations recorded, like purchases or logins, which can add up to massive amounts of data over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Tables:</strong> Structured data organized into tables, often seen in relational databases. A large enterprise might have thousands of tables.</li>
    <li><strong>Files:</strong> Data stored in files, which can vary greatly in size. Large datasets might be stored as multiple files, each contributing to the overall data volume.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Social Media Platforms:</strong> Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram generate massive amounts of data daily from user posts, comments, likes, and shares. For instance, Facebook processes over 100 billion messages daily.</li>
    <li><strong>E-commerce Sites:</strong> Sites like Amazon handle enormous volumes of data from user transactions, product searches, and customer reviews.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Velocity</h4>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Velocity refers to the speed at which data is generated, processed, and analyzed. In the context of Big Data, it involves real-time or near-real-time data processing to make timely decisions.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Near Time:</strong> Data is processed with a slight delay, such as in hourly updates. This is common in systems that can tolerate some lag.</li>
    <li><strong>Real Time:</strong> Data is processed and acted upon instantly or within a very short time frame. Essential for applications requiring immediate responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Streams:</strong> Continuous data flows that need to be processed in real time, such as live video feeds or sensor data.</li>
    <li><strong>Batches:</strong> Data is collected and processed in chunks or batches at scheduled intervals, such as daily or weekly reports.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Financial Markets:</strong> Stock exchanges and trading platforms process millions of transactions per second. High-frequency trading algorithms need to analyze and act on this data almost instantaneously.</li>
    <li><strong>Online Streaming:</strong> Platforms like Netflix and Spotify analyze streaming data in real-time to provide instant recommendations and improve user experience.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Variety</h4>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Variety refers to the different types and formats of data being collected. This includes structured data (like databases), semi-structured data (like JSON or XML), and unstructured data (like text, images, and videos).</p>
<p><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Structured:</strong> Data organized into predefined schemas, like relational databases with rows and columns.</li>
    <li><strong>Semi-Structured:</strong> Data that does not fit into traditional schemas but still has some organizational properties, such as JSON, XML, or log files.</li>
    <li><strong>Unstructured:</strong> Data with no predefined structure, including text documents, emails, social media posts, and multimedia files.</li>
    <li><strong>Mixed:</strong> Data that combines elements of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured formats.</li>
</ul> A
<ul>
    <li><strong>Customer Interactions:</strong> In retail, data comes from structured sources like transaction records, semi-structured sources like customer feedback forms, and unstructured sources like social media posts and online reviews.</li>
    <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Patient data can be structured (like electronic health records), semi-structured (like medical imaging metadata), and unstructured (like clinical notes and diagnostic reports).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Veracity</h4>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Veracity refers to the accuracy, reliability, and trustworthiness of the data. It involves dealing with data quality issues, such as inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Healthcare Data:</strong> Ensuring the accuracy of patient data is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment. Inaccurate data can lead to incorrect treatment decisions and compromised patient safety.</li>
    <li><strong>Survey Data:</strong> For research purposes, the reliability of data collected from surveys or questionnaires must be high. Errors or biases in survey responses can lead to incorrect conclusions.</li>
</ul>
